            BoPlanets is a virtual planetarium, which shows the
            positions of the planets in the solar system relative to an observing planet,
            which can be selected out of the planets and the sun. The planets can be shown
            in various views. In the ecliptic view the Cartesian coordinates, in the
            equatorial view right ascension and declination, in the horizontal view azimuth
            and altitude of the planets relative to an observing planet are displayed. In
            the horizontal view the position of the observer on the observing planet can be
            the current location of the phone (the location of the phone on the planet is the 
            same as on earth)or can be determined by an address (analogical to the earth as 
            observing planet).

            <P>A list of rise, transit and set times of a planet,
                as seen by an observer on the observing planet, may be generated.</P>
            <P>You may have a look to the epicycles of the planets, observed from the 
                earth or any other planet.</P>
            <P>You can let the planets moving by single steps or let them
                run continuously. The speed may be varied by a speed slider. </P>
            <br/>
            There is the paid version BoPlanets-Plus with full functionality and the
            free version BoPlanets with restricted functionality.
            <br/>The following functions are available in the Plus-Version only:

                <li>Bug fix: when a dialog was opened (e.g. <i>Horizon at address</i>)
                    and the home button was clicked, the error message <i>leaking window</i>
                    was issued. Sometimes a forced close happened.
                </li>
                <li>When <i>Horizon at location</i> is selected and location
                    access was not activated, settings of <i>Location access</i>
                    is opened.
                </li>
                <li>When <i>Horizon at address</i> is selected and no network 
                    connection was activated, settings of the device are opened.
                </li>
            </ul>
