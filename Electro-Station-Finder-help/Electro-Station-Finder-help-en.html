            <h1><a id="About_EVSE_Finder">About Electro Station Finder EUR</a></h1>
            Electro Station Finder calculates a route and searches for electric charging stations. Charging stations can be 
            searched along this route or around a location.
            <br/>Charging stations along the route can be restricted to the vicinity of refuelling stops, whose distance from
            each other is the cruising range with the achievable loading state of batteries at refueling stations, 
            which often is lower than 100% of the capacity of the batteries.
            <p>
                In <i>Settings</i> of the action bar the user can configure the start action, which is shown at start of the app. The start action can be
                the <i>Route Request</i> or the <i>Circular Search</i> of charging stations. The start action may be shown or executed immendiately applying
                the last used search criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
                The route is shown on the map as a red line with route markes at start, intermediate destinations and final destination. 
                Charging stations are presented as cluster or single station markers dependent on the zoom level.
                <br/>A navigation system can be selected for navigating from the current position to the selected marker.
            </p>
            <p>
                The list of stations can be saved to sd card. It can be imported 
                to navigate to a selected station. This is done without 
                using the internet.
            </p>
            <p> There are a free version Electro Station Finder EUR and a paid version Electro Station Finder Plus EUR.
                The Plus version offers additional search criteria <i>Free Charging</i>, <i>Barrier Free Payment system</i>
                and <i>Charge Cards</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The station data are provided by 
                <a href="https://www.goingelectric.de/"><b>https://www.goingelectric.de/</b></a>
                <br/>Electro Station Finder downloads the required station data for each new route request and for each new location.
            </p>
            <p>
                GoingElectric provides and maintains station data nearly for all European countries. Completeness and actuality depends on registered users,
                who can send updates of the stations. This works pretty well for Austria, Switzerland and Germany. Other countries may lack of completeness and actuality.
            </p>

            <h1><a id="LanguageSetting">Setting the language</a></h1>
            Electro Station Finder is bilingual. If the language of the phone was set in 'Settings',
            'Language &amp; Keyboard' or 'Language &amp; Input'to German, all texts of Electro Station Finder appear in German,
            for all other languages in English.
            <br/>If the language was set to English(UK) or English(US), distances are measured in miles.
            <br/>If the language is modified, while Electro Station Finder is active, then generated lists
            of a route and stations are shown in the previous language as long as these lists are generated again.

            <h1><a id="UserViews">User views</a></h1>
            The user interacts with Electro Station Finder by user views.
            <br/>There are the following user views:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>The application starts with the view <i>Map</i> and shows an empty map centred 
                    at the current location, it this is known by the phone After a route was calculated and after loading stations 
                    are present, the stations are shown on the map.
                </li>
                <li>View <i>Route</i> contains a form to request a new route and shows a
                    formerly calculated route.
                </li>
                <li>View <i>Stations</i> searches for charging stations
                    and shows a short description of the station.</li>
                <li>With view <i>Import</i> a list of stations, which was stored on external 
                    storage, can be imported.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Navigating to other views is done by option menus. 
            The menu items are shown in the action bar on top of the screen. Dependent on 
            available space an item is shown with its icon and with title. If 
            the space is not sufficient, the icons of the first items are shown; the remaining 
            items are shown by clicking the vertical three dots.
            <p>
                Clicking the left icon (3 horizontal lines or 
                an arrow to the left) in the action bar at the top of the screen toggles between the views <i>Route</i>, <i>Map</i> and 
                <i>Stations</i>. The same can be done by swiping from the left side of the screen or back 
                or by swiping from the right side of the screen or back.
                <br/>The views <i>Route</i> and <i>Stations</i> cover a part of the map, which is slightly dimmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking the back key immediately finishes a view or dialog and returns
                to the view, which initially invoked it. The data of the finished view are lost.
            </p>

            <h1><a id="ViewRouteForm">View Route</a></h1>
            For requesting a route enter the address of the start location
            into the 'From' field and the address of the final destination into  'To' field.(Since V1.0.4 without waypoints separated by semicolon ';').
            <p>
                Button <i>Waypoints</i> opens a list of waypoints. A waypoint can be added as an address. If charging stations are already found, a station can be added
                as a waypoint by selecting it on the map and adding it in the view <i>Waypoints</i> or by entering the station number.
                <br/>Adding a charging station as waypoint will show the loop way from the route to the station after the next route request.
            </p> 
            By clicking the black cross on orange background a waypoint can be removed. The order of waypoints is arbitrary.
            <br/>By clicking the button <i>Ready</i> the actual waypoints will be applied in requesting a route.

            <br/>Addresses may be in the form used by Google Maps, for example:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>complete address:Zip code, City, street house number, country name
                    or country code
                    <br/>example: 4056, Basel, Hebelstrasse 11, CH  </li>
                <li>incomplete address: City or City, street  </li>
                <li>geographical latitude, longitude in decimal degrees
                    <br/>example: 49.0488, 11.1429
                </li>
            </ul>
            If the the <i>From</i> field is long clicked, the last known position of the phone
            is used as the From address. Google's Location Service must be activated in the 
            phone's Settings.

            <p>Buttons:</p>
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>Button Waypoints: opens the view for editing waypoints.</li>
                <li>Swap From/To Address:
                    <br/>Start address and final destination address are swapped.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid Highways: if checked highways will be avoided.</li>
                <li>Get Route: get the route.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Menu items in the action bar: <a  href="#ViewMap">s. View Map</a></p>

            When the result of the route request is available the route steps
            are shown in a list and the route is displayed on the map.
            <br/>After a successful route request the settings of the request are saved and 
            restored after restart of Electro Station Finder.

            <h1><a id="ViewMap">View Map</a></h1>
            The view <i>Map</i> presents the requested route and the searched stations on the map. 

            <h2><a id="UseGoogleMaps"> Use of Google Maps</a></h2>
            Electro Station Finder is based on Google Maps, which requires that Google Play Services are installed on the
            device. If not, the user is requested to install these services from Google Play Store.
            This requires that the app Google Play Store is installed and the device is signed on with its 
            GoogleMail account.

            <h2>Menu items</h2>
            The actionbar on top of the screen contains the menu items. It can 
            be accessed by the views <i>Route</i>, <i>Map</i> and <i>Stations</i>.
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>Settings:
                    <ul class="level2">
                        <li>Selection of satellite view, showing traffic info and current location button.</li>
                        <li>Selection of the start action <i>Routen Request</i> or <i>Circular Search.</i>.</li>
                        <li>With/Without immediate execution of the start action.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Handling of touch/click events</h2>
            The route is shown as a red line together with green markers at start,stopovers and end point. Stations are presented as markers for higher            
            zoom levels. The color of the marker indicates the maximum power of the charging points of this station: 
            <br/>violet < 11 KW (L=1), blue < 22 KW (L2), yellow < 50 KW, brown >= 50 KW (L4).
            <br/>For lower zoom levels stations are clustered; the cluster markers show the number of contained stations.

            <p>Clicking a cluster marker zooms in and shows the station markers of this cluster.</p>
            <p>Clicking a marker will open an info window with a short description of this marker. A short click on the map closes the info window.
                <br/>Clicking the bar <i> Get Station Details</i> of an info window opens the details of this charging station.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking an arrow button in the middle left and right of the screen steps to the
                next marker, forwards by the the right button and backwards by the
                left button. This affects route and station markers.
            </p>

            <h2>Using a navigation sytem</h2>
            If a route marker or a station marker is selected, clicking the button with 
            a blue right arrow at the bottom of the screen opens a
            dialog asking the user, if he wants to navigate with the shown navi system 
            from the current position to the selected marker. The address of the selected 
            marker is shown, if an internet connection exists. Clicking the field with the 
            navi system opens a list of navi systems, from which one may be selected.
            Clicking <i>Yes</i> opens the selected navigation system, if it is installed on the android device.
            <p> </p>
