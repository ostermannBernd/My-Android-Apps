            <h1><a id="About_Cng_Lpg_Finder">About Cng/Lpg Finder</a></h1>
            Cng/Lpg Finder is an Android application, which calculates a route and shows the
            natural gas (CNG) or liquified petroleum gas (LPG) fuel stations in Europe, USA or Canada along
            this route with a given maximum distance to the route or within a circle with a 
            given radius around a location. The location may be obtained by the location service 
            of the phone or an address entered by the user.
            <br/>The fuel stations along the route can be restricted to the vicinity of refuelling stops, whose distance from
            each other is the cruising range with a full tank.
            <p>
                In <i>Settings</i> of the action bar the user can configure the start action, which is shown at start of the app. The start action can be
                the <i>Route Request</i> or the <i>Circular Search</i> of charging stations. The start action may be shown or executed immendiately applying
                the last used search criteria.
            </p>
            <p> The following navigation systems can be used to navigate to a selected point of
                the route or a selected fuel station:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>Google Maps</li>
                <li>Sygic GPS</li>
                <li>Navigon</li>
                <li>WAZE GPS</li>
                <li>HERE WeGo </li>
                <li>OsmAnd</li>
            </ul>
            The list of stations can be saved to sd card. It can be imported 
            to navigate to a selected station. This is done by Cng/LPG Finder without 
            using the internet.
            <p> There is a free version Cng/Lpg Finder and a paid version
                Cng/Lpg Finder Plus. 
                <br/>Cng/Lpg Finder Plus provides additional functions
                for maintaining station files and searching for stations in ECO mode. 
                <br/>Maintaining consists of downloading station files from
                a web site to external storage (as sdcard), updating from external storage  
                and resetting to the initially installed station files. 
                <br/>Coloured price indicators are added to station markers in
                <i>map</i> view to ease finding well priced gas stations.
                <br/>In ECO mode stations for refuelling are selected so, that cost 
                savings are a maximum compared to stations with the mean price along 
                the route.
            </p>

            <h1><a id="LanguageSetting">Setting the language</a></h1>
            Cng/Lpg Finder is bilingual. If the language of the phone was set in 'Settings',
            'Language &amp; Keyboard' or 'Language &amp; Input'to German, all texts of Cng/Lpg Finder appear in German,
            for all other languages in English.
            <br/>If the language was set to English(UK) or English(US), distances are measured in miles and 
            gas consumption is given by Miles per  GB or US Gallon (Lpg) and by Miles per Kg (Cng). 
            (Required for Eco mode).
            <br/>If the language is modified, while Cng/Lpg Finder is active, then generated lists
            as route and station details are shown in the previous language as long as
            these lists are generated again.

            <h1><a id="UserViews">User views</a></h1>
            The user interacts with Cng/Lpg Finder by user views.
            <br/>There are the following user views:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>The application starts with the view <i>Map</i> and shows an empty map centred 
                    at the current location. After a route was calculated the route, and after gas stations 
                    are present, the stations are shown on the map.
                </li>
                <li>View <i>Route</i> contains a form to request a new route or shows a
                    formerly calculated route.
                </li>
                <li>View <i>Stations</i> searches for gas stations
                    and shows the details of gas stations.</li>
                <li>Plus version only: view <i>Maintain</i> shows a form for downloading
                    station data from the internet to external storage (e.g. sd card), 
                    for updating station data from external storage and for resetting data
                    to the originally installed station data.

            Navigating to other views is done by option menus. 
            The menu items are shown in the action bar on top of the screen. Dependent on 
            available space an item is shown with its icon and possibly with title. If 
            the space is not sufficient, the icons of the first items are shown; the remaining

            <h1><a id="ViewRouteForm">View Route</a></h1>
            For requesting a route enter the address of the start location
            into the 'From' field and the address of the final destination into  'To' field.(Since V4.2.5 without waypoints separated by semicolon ';').
            <p>
                Button <i>Waypoints</i> opens a list of waypoints. A waypoint can be added as an address. If stations are already found, a station can be added
                as a waypoint by selecting it on the map and adding it in the view <i>Waypoints</i> or by entering the station number.
                <br/>Adding a charging station as waypoint will show the loop way from the route to the station after the next route request.
            </p> 
            By clicking the black cross on orange background a waypoint can be removed. The order of waypoints is arbitrary.
            <br/>By clicking the button <i>Ready</i> the actual waypoints will be applied in requesting a route.

            <br/>Addresses may be in the form used by Google Maps, for example:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>complete address:Zip code, City, street house number, country name
                    or country code

                </li>
            </ul>
            If the the <i>From</i> field is long clicked, the last known position of the phone
            is used as the From address. Google's Location Service must be activated in the 
            phone's Settings.

            The route is shown as a red line together with green markers at start,
            stopovers and end point. The stations are presented as pushpin markers for higher
            zoom levels. For lower zoom levels stations are clustered; the cluster markers show 
            the number of contained stations.
            <br/>Cng/Lpg Finder Plus adds colored price indicators 
            (green, yellow, orange, red) to station markers, which indicate the 
            price class of a station. The price class is based on the country 
            mean price.
            <p>Clicking a cluster marker zooms in and shows the station markers
                of this cluster.</p>
            <p>Clicking a marker will open an info window with a description of
                this marker. A short click on the map closes the info window.

            <h1><a id="ViewStationsView">View Stations</a></h1>
            With the view <i>Stations</i> Cng- or Lpg stations can be searched along a route 
            or around a location within a given radius.
            The stations along a route may be restricted
            to the vicinity of refuelling stops, which are apart from the next stop
            approximately in a distance of the refuelling range. The first refuelling stop
            is at start of the route.
            <br/>Stations along a route can be searched in ECO mode (Plus version only).
            In this mode stations are selected with the maximum  cost savings compared to 
            the mean price along the route.
            <br/>At refuelling stops the tank is completely refilled. As a result the gas amount 
            required for the route, the gas costs and the cost savings compared to stations 
            with the mean price along the route are shown.
            <br/>If there are no stations with pricing on a route section to the next 
            refuelling stop, ECO mode is not applicable.
            <p>The radius search can be done around a location given by the 
                location service of the phone or determined by an address enetered by the user.
            </p>
            <p>The result of searching for stations can be saved to a html file on 
                external storage (e.g. sd card). This file can be imported by clicking 
                the menu item <i>Import</i>. This can be used for navigating to a station of 
                this file without having an internet connection.
