            <h1><a id="About_EVSE_Finder">About EV Station Finder USA&CAN</a></h1>
            EV Station Finder USA&CAN is an Android application for USA and Canada, which calculates a route and shows electric loading stations with  electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE),
            along this route with a given maximum distance to the route or within a circle with a 
            given radius around a location. The location may be obtained by the location service 
            of the phone or an address entered by the user.
            <br/>The EVSE stations along the route can be restricted to the vicinity of refuelling stops, 
            whose distance from each other is the cruising range with the achievable loading state of batteries at refueling stations, 
            which often is lower than 100% of the capacity of the batteries.

            <p>
                The To Address of a route request is now the final end address without waypoints separated by semikolon.
                Waypoints can be added in arbitrary order to a list.
                If stations are already found, a selected station can be added to the list.
                The next route request shows the loop way from the route to this station.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <i>Settings</i> of the action bar the user can configure the start action, which is shown at start of the app. The start action can be
                the <i>Route Request</i> or the <i>Circular Search</i> of charging stations. The start action may be shown or executed immendiately applying
                the last used search criteria.
            </p>

            <p> The following navigation systems can be used to navigate to a selected point of
                the route or a selected EVSE station:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>Google Maps</li>
                <li>Sygic GPS</li>
                <li>Navigon GPS</li>
                <li>WAZE GPS</li>
                <li>HERE WeGo</li>
                <li>OsmAnd</li>
            </ul>
            The list of stations can be saved to shared external storage. It can be imported 
            to navigate to a selected station. This is done without 
            using the internet.
            <p> There is a free version EV Station Finder USA&CAN and a paid version
                EV Station Finder USA&CAN Plus. 
                <br/>EV Station Finder USA&CAN Plus provides additional functions
                for maintaining station data. 
                <br/>Maintaining consists of downloading station data from
                a web site to external storage (as sdcard), updating from external storage  
                and resetting to the initially installed station files. 
            </p>


            <h1><a id="LanguageSetting">Setting the language</a></h1>
            EV Station Finder USA&CAN is bilingual. If the language of the phone was set in 'Settings',
            'Language &amp; Keyboard' or 'Language &amp; Input'to German, all texts of EV Station Finder USA&CAN appear in German,
            for all other languages in English.
            <br/>If the language was set to English(UK) or English(US), distances are measured in miles.
            <br/>If the language is modified, while EV Station Finder USA&CAN is active, then generated lists
            as route and station details are shown in the previous language as long as
            these lists are generated again.

            <h1><a id="UserViews">User views</a></h1>
            The user interacts with EV Station Finder USA&CAN by user views.
            <br/>There are the following user views:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>The application starts with the view <i>Map</i> and shows an empty map centred 
                    at the current location. After a route was calculated and after loading stations 
                    are present, the stations are shown on the map.
                </li>
                <li>View <i>Route</i> contains a form to request a new route or shows a
                    formerly calculated route.
                </li>
                <li>View <i>Stations</i> searches for EVSE stations
                    and shows the station details.</li>
                <li>Plus version only: view <i>Maintain</i> shows a form for downloading
                    station data from the internet to external storage (e.g. sd card), 
                    for updating station data from external storage and for resetting data
                    to the originally installed station data.
                </li>
                <li>With view <i>Import</i> a list of stations, which was stored on external 
                    storage, can be imported.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Navigating to other views is done by option menus. 
            The menu items are shown in the action bar on top of the screen. Dependent on 
            available space an item is shown with its icon and with title. If 
            the space is not sufficient, the icons of the first items are shown; the remaining 
            items are shown by clicking the vertical three dots.
            <p>
                Clicking the left icon (3 horizontal lines or 
                an arrow to the left) in the action bar at the top of the screen toggles between the views <i>Route</i>, <i>Map</i> and 
                <i>Stations</i>. The same can be done by swiping from the left side of the screen or back 
                or by swiping from the right side of the screen or back.
                <br/>The views <i>Route</i> and <i>Stations</i> cover a part of the map, which is slightly dimmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking the back key immediately finishes a view or dialog and returns
                to the view, which initially invoked it. The data of the finished view are lost.
            </p>

            <h1><a id="ViewRouteForm">View Route</a></h1> 
            For requesting a route enter the address of the start location
            into the 'From' field and the address of the final destination into  'To' field.(Since V1.0.4 without waypoints separated by semicolon ';').
            <p>
                Button <i>Waypoints</i> opens a list of waypoints. A waypoint can be added as an address. If stations are already found, a station can be added
                as a waypoint by selecting it on the map and adding it in the view <i>Waypoints</i> or by entering the station number.
                <br/>Adding a charging station as waypoint will show the loop way from the route to the station after the next route request.
            </p> 
            By clicking the black cross on orange background a waypoint can be removed. The order of waypoints is arbitrary.
            <br/>By clicking the button <i>Ready</i> the actual waypoints will be applied in requesting a route.

            <br/>Addresses may be in the form used by Google Maps, for example:
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>complete address:Zip code, City, street house number, country name
                    or country code
                    <br/>example: 4056, Basel, Hebelstrasse 11, CH  </li>
                <li>incomplete address: City or City, street  </li>
                <li>geographical latitude, longitude in decimal degrees
                    <br/>example: 43.0488, -76.1429
                </li>
            </ul>
            If the the <i>From</i> field is long clicked, the last known position of the phone
            is used as the From address. Google's Location Service must be activated in the 
            phone's Settings.

            <p>Buttons:</p>
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>Swap From/To Address:
                    <br/>Start address and final destination address are swapped.
                </li>
                <li>Avoid Highways: if checked highways will be avoided.</li>
                <li>Get Route: get the route.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Menu items in the action bar: <a  href="#ViewMap">s. View Map</a></p>

            When the result of the route request is available the route details 
            are shown and the route is displayed on the map.
            <br/>After a successful route request the settings of the request are saved and 
            restored after restart of EV Station Finder USA.

            <h1><a id="ViewMap">View Map</a></h1>
            The view <i>Map</i> presents the requested route and the searched stations on the map. 

            <h2><a id="UseGoogleMaps"> Use of Google Maps</a></h2>
            EV Station Finder USA&CAN is based on Google Maps, which requires that Google Play Services are installed on the
            device. If not, the user is requested to install these services from Google Play Store.
            This requires that the app Google Play Store is installed and the device is signed on with its 
            GoogleMail account.

            <h2>Menu items</h2>
            The actionbar on top of the screen contains the menu items. It can 
            be accessed by the views <i>Route</i>, <i>Map</i> and <i>Stations</i>.
            <ul class="level1">
                <li>Settings: regarding connector types and charging levels of stations to be searched and map views 
                    (satellite, traffic info and current location).</li>
                <li>Stations: toggles between the views <i>Stations</i> and <i>Map</i>.</li>
                <li>Import: opens a file picker for selecting a formerly saved station list for importing
                    from external storage.
                </li>
                <li>Maintain (Plus version only): opens the sub nenu for maintaining stations data.</li>
                <li>Help: opens help information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Handling of touch/click events</h2>
            The route is shown as a red line together with green markers at start,
            stopovers and end point. The stations are presented as markers for higher
            zoom levels. The color of the marker indicates the charging level of the station: violet for level 1, blue for level2, 
            yellow for DC fast and light green for legacy charging systems.
            <br/>For lower zoom levels stations are clustered; the cluster markers show
            the number of contained stations.

            <p>Clicking a cluster marker zooms in and shows the station markers
                of this cluster.</p>
            <p>Clicking a marker will open an info window with a description of
                this marker. A short click on the map closes the info window.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking an arrow button in the middle left and right of the screen steps to the
                next marker, forwards by the the right button and backwards by the
                left button. This affects route and station markers.
            </p>

            <h2>Using a navigation sytem</h2>
            If a route marker or a station marker is selected, clicking the button with 
            a blue right arrow opens a
            dialog asking the user, if he wants to navigate with the shown navi system 
            from the current position to the selected marker. The address of the selected 
            marker is shown, if an internet connection exists. Clicking the field with the 
            navi system opens a list of navi systems, from which one may be selected.
            Clicking <i>Yes</i> opens the selected navigation system,
            if it is installed on the android device.
            <p> </p>

            With the view <i>Stations</i> EVSE stations can be searched along a route 
            or around a location within a given radius.
            The stations along a route may be restricted
            to the vicinity of refuelling stops, which are apart from the next stop
            approximately in a distance of the refuelling range. 
            <p>The radius search can be done around a location given by the
